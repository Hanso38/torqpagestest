<h1 id="processes">Processes</h1>
<p>A set of processes is included. These processes build upon AquaQ TorQ,
providing specific functionality. All the process scripts are contained
in $KDBCODE/processes. All processes should have an entry in
$KDBCONFIG/process.csv. All processes can have any type and name,
except for discovery services which must have a process type of
“discovery”. An example process.csv is:</p>
<pre><code>aquaq$ cat config/process.csv
host,port,proctype,procname
aquaq,9998,rdb,rdb_europe_1
aquaq,9997,hdb,rdb_europe_1aquaq,9999,hdb,hdb1

<h2 id="discovery-service">Discovery Service</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Processes use the discovery service to register their own availability,
find other processes (by process type) and subscribe to receive updates
for new process availability (by process type). The discovery service
does not manage connections- it simply returns tables of registered
processes, irrespective of their current availability. It is up to each
individual process to manage its own connections.</p>
<p>The discovery service uses the process.csv file to make connections to
processes on start up. After start up it is up to each individual
process to attempt connections and register with the discovery service.
This is done automatically, depending on the configuration parameters.
Multiple discovery services can be run in which case each process will
try to register and retrieve process details from each discovery process
it finds in its process.csv file. Discovery services do not replicate
between themselves. A discovery process must have its process type
listed as discovery.</p>
<p>To run the discovery service, use a start line such as:</p>
<pre><code>aquaq $ q torq.q -load code/processes/discovery.q -p 9995
</code></pre>
<p>Modify the configuration as required.</p>

<h2 id="gateway">Gateway</h2>
<p>A synchronous and asynchronous gateway is provided. The gateway can be
used for load balancing and/or to join the results of queries across
heterogeneous servers (e.g. an RDB and HDB). Ideally the gateway should
only be used with asynchronous calls. Synchronous calls cause the
gateway to block so limits the gateway to serving one query at a time
(although if querying across multiple backend servers the backend
queries will be run in parallel). When using asynchronous calls the
client can either block and wait for the result (deferred synchronous)
or post a call back function which the gateway will call back to the
client with. With both asynchronous and synchronous queries the backend
servers to execute queries against are selected using process type. The
gateway API can be seen by querying .api.p“.gw.*” within a gateway
process.</p>
<p><img alt="Gateway behaviour" src="../graphics/async.png" /></p>
<h3 id="asynchronous-behaviour">Asynchronous Behaviour</h3>
<p>Asynchronous queries allow much greater flexibility. They allow multiple
queries to be serviced at once, prioritisation, and queries to be timed
out. When an asynchronous query is received the following happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the query is placed in a queue;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the list of available servers is retrieved;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the queue is prioritised, so those queries with higher priority are
      serviced first;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>queries are sent to back end servers as they become available. Once
      the backend server returns its result, it is given another query;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when all the partial results from the query are returned the results
      are aggregated and returned to the client. They are either returned
      directly, or wrapped in a callback and posted back asynchronously to
      the client.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The two main customisable features of the gateway are the selection of
available servers (.gw.availableservers) and the queue prioritisation
(.gw.getnextqueryid). With default configuration, the available servers
are those servers which are not currently servicing a query from the
gateway, and the queue priority is a simple FIFO queue. The available
servers could be extended to handle process attributes, such as the
available datasets or the location of the process, and the queue
prioritisation could be modified to anything required e.g. based on the
query itself, the username, host of the client etc.</p>
<p>An asynchronous query can be timed out using a timeout defined by the
client. The gateway will periodically check if any client queries have
not completed in the alotted time, and return a timeout error to the
client. If the query is already running on any backend servers then they
cannot be timed out other than by using the standard -T flag.</p>
<h3 id="synchronous-behaviour">Synchronous Behaviour</h3>
<p>When using synchronous queries the gateway can only handle one query at
a time and cannot timeout queries other than with the standard -T flag.
All synchronous queries will be immediately dispatched to the back end
processes. They will be dispatched using an asyhcnronous call, allowing
them to run in parallel rather than serially. When the results are
received they are aggregated and returned to the client.</p>
<h3 id="process-discovery">Process Discovery</h3>
<p>The gateway uses the discovery service to locate processes to query
across. The discovery service will notify the gateway when new processes
become available and the gateway will automatically connect and start
using them. The gateway can also use the static information in
process.csv, but this limits the gateway to a predefined list of
processes rather than allowing new services to come online as demand
requires.</p>
<h3 id="error-handling">Error Handling</h3>
<p>When synchronous calls are used, q errors are returned to clients as
they are encountered. When using asynchronous calls there is no way to
return actual errors and appropriately prefixed strings must be used
instead. It is up to the client to check the type of the received result
and if it is a string then whether it contains the error prefix. The
error prefix can be changed, but the default is “error: ”. Errors will
be returned when:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the client requests a query against a server type which the gateway
    does not currently have any active instances of (this error is
    returned immediately);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the query is timed out;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a back end server returns an error;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a back end server fails;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the join function fails.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If postback functions are used, the error string will be posted back
within the postback function (i.e. it will be packed the same way as a
valid result).</p>
<h3 id="client-calls">Client Calls</h3>
<p>There are four main client calls. The .gw.sync* methods should only be
invoked synchronously, and the .gw.async* methods should only be
invoked asynchronously. Each of these are documented more extensively in
the gateway api. Use .api.p“.gw.*” for more details.</p>

<h2 id="real-time-database-rdb">Real Time Database (RDB)</h2>
<p>The Real Time Database is a modified version of r.q found in kdb+tick.
The modifications from the standard r.q include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tickerplant (data source) and HDB location derived from processes
    defined by the discovery service or from config file;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatic re-connection and resubscription to tickerplant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>List of tables to subscribe to supplied as configuration setting;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More pre-built flexibility in end-of-day;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More verbose end-of-day logging;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reload multiple authenticated HDBs after end-of-day;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>End-of-day save down manipulation code is shared between RDB, WDB
      and tickerplant log replay</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See the top of the file for more information.</p>
<p><a name="wdb"></a></p>
<h2 id="write-database-wdb">Write Database (WDB)</h2>
<p>The Write Database or WDB is based on w.q. This process features a
number of modifications and enhancements over w.q:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Provides the option to write down to a custom partition scheme,
    defined by parted columns in sort.csv, which removes the need for
    end of day sorting;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater configuration options; max rows on a per table basis, list
     subscription tables, upd function etc. See the top of the process
     file for the options;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of common code with the RDB and Tickerplant Log Replay process
     to manipulate tables before save, sort and apply attributes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Checks whether to persist data to disk on a timer rather than on
     each tick;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Informs other RDB, HDB and GW processes that end of day save and
     sort has completed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More log information supplied.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The WDB process can broken down into two main functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Periodically saving data to disk and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorting data at end of day</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The WDB process provides flexibility so it can be set-up as a
stand-alone process that will both save and sort data or two separate
processes (one that saves the data and another that will sort the data
on disk). This allows greater flexibility around the end of day event as
sorting data can be time consuming. It is also helps when implementing
seemless rollovers (i.e. no outage window at end-of-day).</p>
<p>The behaviour of the WDB process is controlled by the <code>.wdb.mode</code>
parameter. This should be set to one of following three values:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>saveandsort - the process will subscribe for data, periodically
    write data to disk and at EOD it will flush remaining data to disk
    before sorting it and informing GWs, RDBs and HDBs etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>save - the process will subscribe for data, periodically write data
      to disk and at EOD it will flush remaining data to disk. It will
      then inform its respective sort mode process to sort the data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sort - the process will wait to get a trigger from its respective
      save mode process. When this is triggered it will sort the data on
      disk, apply attributes and the trigger a reload on the RDB, HDB and
      GW processes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When running a system with separate save and sort process, the sort
process should be configured in the processes.csv file with a proctype
of sort. The save process will check for processes with a proctype of
sort when it attempts to trigger the end of day sort of the data.</p>
<p>The wdb process provides two methods for persisting data to disk and
sorting at the end of the day.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>default - Data is persisted into a partition defined by the
    [partitiontype] variable, similar to the hdb partition scheme. The
    general scheme is of the form
    [wdbdir]/[partitiontype]/[table]/. And a typical partition
    directory would be similar to wdb/database/2015.11.26/trades/. At
    the end of the day, before being moved to the hdb, the data is
    sorted according to parameters defined in sort.csv. For each table,
    sort.csv will specify the columns to sort (using xasc) and apply
    attributes to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>partbyattr - Data is persisted to a custom partition scheme, derived
      from parameters in the sort.csv file. The write down scheme is taken
      from sort.csv, to reflect the effect of using xasc at the end of
      day. For each table, the columns defined in sort.csv, with the
      parted attribute, are used to create custom partitions in the wdb.
      Multiple columns can be defined with the parted attribute and
      distinct combinations of each are generated for custom partitions.
      The general partition scheme is of the form
      [wdbdir]/[partitiontype]/[table]/[parted column(s)]/. And a
      typical partition directory would be similar to
      wdb/database/2015.11.26/trade/MSFT_N. In the above example, the
      data is parted by sym and source, and so a unique partition
      directory MSFT_N is created in the wdb directory.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, data is upserted into the hdb without the
  need for sorting. The number of rows that are joined at once is
  limited by the mergenumrows and mergenumtab parameters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The optional partbyattr method may provide a significant saving in time
at the end of day, allowing the hdb to be accessed sooner. For large
data sets with a low cardinality (ie. small number of distinct elements)
the optional method may provide a significant time saving, upwards of
50%. The optional method should also reduce the memory usage at the end
of day event, as joining data is generally less memory intensive than
sorting.</p>
<p><a name="tick"></a></p>
<h2 id="tickerplant-log-replay">Tickerplant Log Replay</h2>
<p>The Tickerplant Log Replay script is for replaying tickerplant logs.
This is useful for:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>handling end of day save down failures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>handling large volumes of data (larger than can fit into RAM).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The process takes as the main input either an individual log file to
replay, or a directory containing a set of log files. Amongst other
functionality, the process can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>replay specific message ranges;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>replay in manageable message chunks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recover as many messages as possible from a log file rather than
      just stopping at the first bad message;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ignore specific tables;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>modify the tables before or after they are saved;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>apply sorting and parting after all the data is written out.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The process must have some variables set (the tickerplant log file or
directory, the schema file, and the on-disk database directory to write
to) or it will fail on startup. These can either be set in the config
file, or overridden from the command line in the usual way. An example
start line would be:</p>
<pre><code>q torq.q -debug -load code/processes/tickerlogreplay.q -p 9990 -.replay.tplogfile ../test/tplogs/marketdata2013.12.17 -.replay.schemafile ../test/marketdata.q -.replay.hdbdir ../test/hdb1
</code></pre>
<p>The tickerplant log replay script has extended usage information which
can be accessed with -.replay.usage.</p>

<p><a name="house"></a></p>
<h2 id="housekeeping">Housekeeping</h2>
<p>The housekeeping process is used to undertake periodic system
housekeeping and maintenance, such as compressing or removing files
which are no longer required. The process will run the housekeeping jobs
periodically on a timer. Amongst other functionality the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Allows for removing and zipping of directory files;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides an inbuilt search utility and selectively searches using a
      ‘find’ and ‘exclude’ string, and an ‘older than’ parameter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reads all tasks from a single CSV;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Runs on a user defined timer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be run immediately from command line or within the process;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be easily extended to include new user defined housekeeping
      tasks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The process has two main parameters that should be set prior to use;
runtimes and inputcsv.‘Runtimes’ sets the timer to run housekeeping at
the set time(s), and ‘Inputcsv’ provides the location of the
housekeeping csv file. These can either be set in the config file, or
overridden via the command line. If these are not set, then default
parameters are used; 12.00 and ‘KDBCONFIG/housekeeping.csv’
respectively. The process is designed to run from a single csv file with
five headings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Function details the action that you wish to be carried out on the
    files, initially, this can be rm (remove) and zip (zipping);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Path specifies the directory that the files are in;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Match provides the search string to the find function, files
      returned will have names that match this string;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exclude provides a second string to the find function, and these
      files are excluded from the match list;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Age is the ‘older than’ parameter, and the function will only be
      carried out on files older than the age given (in days).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An example csv file would be:</p>
<pre><code>function,path,match,exclude,age
zip,./logs/,*.log,*tick*,2
rm,./logs/,*.log*,*tick*,4
zip,./logs/,*tick*,,1
rm,./logs/,*tick*,,3

function path      match    exclude  age
----------------------------------------
zip      "./logs/" "*.log"  "*tick*" 2
rm       "./logs/" "*.log*" "*tick*" 4
zip      "./logs/" "*tick*" ""       1
rm       "./logs/" "*tick*" ""       3
</code></pre>
<p>The process reads in the csv file, and passes it line by line to a
‘find’ function; providing a dictionary of values that can be used to
locate the files required. The find function takes advantage of system
commands to search for the files according to the specifications in the
dictionary. A search is performed for both the match string and the
exclude string, and cross referenced to produce a list of files that
match the parameters given. The files are then each passed to a further
set of system commands to perform the task of either zipping or
removing. Note that an incomplete csv or non-existant path will throw an
error.</p>
<p>The remove and zipping functions form only basic implimentations of the
housekeeping process; it is designed to be exended to include more
actions than those provided. Any user function defined in the
housekeeping code can be employed in the same fashion by providing the
name of the function,search string and age of files to the csv.</p>
<p>As well as being scheduled on a timer, the process can also be run
immediately. Adding ‘-hk.runnow 1’ to the command line when starting the
process will force immediate running of the actions in the housekeeping
csv. Likewise, setting runnow to 1b in the config file will immediately
run the cleaning process. Both methods will cause the process to exit
upon completion. Calling hkrun[] from within the q process will also
run the csv instructions immediately. This will not affect any timer
scheduling and the process will remain open upon completion.</p>
<p>Housekeeping works both on windows and unix based systems. Since the
process utilizes inbuilt system commands to perform maintenances, a
unix/windows switch detects the operating system of the host and applies
either unix or widows functions appropriately. Extensions need only be
made in the namespace of the hosting operating system (i.e. if you are
using a unix system, and wish to add a new function, you do not need to
add the function to the windows namespace to). Usage information can be
accessed using the ‘-hkusage’ flag:</p>
<pre><code>q torq.q -load code/processes/housekeeping.q -p 9999 -proctype housekeeping -procname hk1 -debug -hkusage
</code></pre>
<p><a name="file"></a></p>
<h2 id="file-alerter">File Alerter</h2>
<p>The file alerter process is a long-running process which periodically
scans a set of directories for user-specified files. If a matching file
is found it will then carry out a user-defined function on it. The files
to search for and the functions to run are read in from a csv file.
Additionally, the file alerter process can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>run more than one function on the specified file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>optionally move the file to a new directory after running the
      function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>store a table of files that have already been processed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>run the function only on new files or run it every time the file is
      modified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ignore any matching files already on the system when the process
      starts and only run a function if a new file is added or a file is
      modified.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The file alerter process has four parameters which should be set prior
to use. These parameters can either be set in the config file or
overridden on the command-line. If they are not set, the default
parameters will be used. The parameters are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>inputcsv</strong> - The name and location of the csv file which defines the
behaviour of the process. The default is KDBCONFIG/filealerter.csv.</p>
<p><strong>polltime</strong> - How often the process will scan for matching files. The
default is 0D:00:01, i.e., every minute.</p>
<p><strong>alreadyprocessed</strong> - The name and location of the already-processed
table. The default is KDBCONFIG/filealerterprocessed. This table will
be created automatically the first time the process is ran.</p>
<p><strong>skipallonstart</strong> - If this is set to 1, it will ignore all files
already on the system; if it is set to 0, it will not. The default
value is 0.</p>
<p>The files to find and the functions to run are read in from a csv file
created by the user. This file has five columns, which are detailed
below.</p>
<p><strong>path</strong> - This is the path to the directory that will be scanned for
the file.</p>
<p><strong>match</strong> - This is a search string matching the name of the file to be
found. Wildcards can be used in this search, for example, “file*” will
find all files starting with “fil”.</p>
<p><strong>function</strong> - This is the name of the function to be run on the file.
This function must be defined in the script
KDBCODE/processes/filealerter.q. If the function is not defined or fails
to run, the process will throw an error and ignore that file from then
on.</p>
<p><strong>newonly</strong> - This is a boolean value. If it is set to 1, it will
only run the function on the file if it has been newly created. If it is
set to 0, then it will run the function every time the file is
modified.</p>
<p><strong>movetodirectory</strong> - This is the path of the directory you would like
to move the file to after it has been processed. If this value is left
blank, the file will not be moved.</p>
<p>It is possible to run two separate functions on the same file by adding
them as separate lines in the csv file. If the file is to be moved after
it is processed, the file alerter will run both functions on the file
and then attempt to move it. A typical csv file to configure the file
alerter would look like:</p>
<pre><code>path,match,function,newonly,movetodirectory
/path/to/dirA,fileA.*,copy,0,/path/to/newDir
/path/to/dirB,fileB.txt,email,1,
/path/to/dirA,fileA.*,delete,0,/path/to/newDir

path        match      function  newonly    movetodirectory
---------------------------------------------------
"/path/to/dirA" "fileA.*"   copy    0   "/path/to/newDir"
"/path/to/dirB" "fileB.txt" email   1   ""
"/path/to/dirA" "fileA.*"   delete  0   "/path/to/newDir"
</code></pre>
<p>The file alerter process reads in each line of the csv file and searches
files matching the search string specified in that line. Note that there
may be more than one file found if a wildcard is used in the search
string. If it finds any files, it will check that they are not in the
already processed table. If newonly is set to 1, it only checks if
the filename is already in the table. If newonly is set to 0, it
checks against the filename, filesize and a md5 hash of the file. The
md5 hash and the filesize are used to determine if the file has been
modified since it was processed last. If the found files have not been
processed already, it then attempts to run the specified function to
these files.</p>
<p>After the process has run through each line of the csv, it generates a
table of all files that were processed on that run. These files are
appended to the already processed table which is then saved to disk. The
file alerter will attempt to move the files to the ‘movetodirectory’, if
specified. If the file has already been moved during the process (for
example, if the function to run on it was ‘delete’), the file alerter
will not attempt to move it.</p>
<p>The file alerter is designed to be extended by the user. Customised
functions should be defined within the filealerter.q script. They should
be diadic functions, i.e., they take two parameters: the path and the
filename. As an example, a simple function to make a copy of a file in
another directory could be:</p>
<pre><code>copy:{[path;file] system "cp ", path,"/", file, " /path/to/newDir"}
</code></pre>
<p>Although the process is designed to run at regular intervals throughout
the day, it can be called manually by invoking the FArun[] command
from within the q session. Similarly, if new lines are added to the csv
file, then it can be re-loaded by calling the loadcsv[] command
from the q session.</p>
<p>Each stage of the process, along with any errors which may occur, are
appropriately logged in the usual manner.</p>
<p>The file alerter process is designed to work on both Windows and Unix
based systems. Since many of the functions defined will use inbuilt
system command they will be need to written to suit the operating system
in use. It should also be noted that Windows does not have an inbuilt
md5 hashing function so the file alerter will only detect different
versions of files if the filename or filesize changes.</p>

<h2 id="reporter">Reporter</h2>
<h3 id="overview_1">Overview</h3>
<p>The reporter process is used to run periodic reports on specific
processes. A report is the result of a query that is run on a process at
a specific time. The result of the query is then handled by one of the
inbuilt result handlers, with the ability to add custom result handlers.</p>
<p><img alt="Reporter process" src="../graphics/reporter.png" /></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Easily create a report for information that you want;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fully customizable scheduling such as start time, end time and days
      of the week;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run reports repeatedly with a custom period between them;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asynchronous querying with custom timeout intervals;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inbuilt result handlers allow reports to be written to file or
      published;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Custom result handlers can be defined;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logs each step of the report process;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fully integrated with the TorQ gateway to allow reports to be run
      across backend processes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The reporter process has three parameters that are read in on
initialisation from the reporter.q file found in the
$KDBCONFIG/settings directory. These settings are the string filepath
of the input csv file, a boolean to output log messages and timestamp
for flushing the query log table.</p>
<p>To run the reporter process:</p>
<pre><code>q torq.q -load code/processes/reporter.q -p 20004
</code></pre>
<p>Once the reporter process has been initiated, the reports will be
scheduled and no further input is required from the user.</p>
<h3 id="report-configuration">Report Configuration</h3>
<p>By default, the process takes its inputs from a file called reporter.csv
which is found in the $KDBCONFIG directory. This allows the user
complete control over the configuration of the reports. As the queries
are evaluated on the target process, local variables can be referenced
or foreign functions can be run. Table [table:reportertable] shows the
meaning of the csv schema.</p>

<p>When running a report on a gateway, the gateway field must be set to the
proctype of the gateway that will be queried. It will then run the
report on the processes which are listed in the proctype field and join
the results by using the function specified in the joinfunction field.
If there is no join function then the reporter process will not start.
Multiple entries in the proctype field must be separated by a space and
are only allowed when the gateway field is not empty. If gateway field
is empty and there are multiple entries in the proctype field then the
reporter process will not load.</p>
<p>Listing [code:csvschema] shows an example of the schema needed in the

</code></pre>
<h3 id="result-handlers">Result Handlers</h3>
<p>There are several default result handlers which are listed below. Custom
result handlers can be defined as required. The result handler will be
invoked with a single parameter (the result of the query).</p>
<p><strong>writetofiletype</strong> - Accepts 3 parameters: path, filename, filetype and
data. When writing to file it uses a date time suffix so the resultant
filename will be <code>usage_rdb_2014_01_02_15_00_12.txt</code> e.g.</p>
<pre><code>writetofiletype["./output/";"usage";"csv"]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>splaytable</strong> - This accepts 3 parameters: path, file and data. This
splays the result to a directory. The result must be a table in order to
use this function e.g.</p>
<pre><code>splaytable["./output/";"usage"]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>emailalert</strong> - This accepts 3 parameters: period, recipient list and
data. The period dictates the throttle i.e. emails will be sent at most
every period. The result of the report must be a table with a single
column called messages which contains the character list of the email
message. This is used with the monitoring checks to raise alerts, but
can be used with other functions.</p>
<pre><code>emailalert[0D00:30;("test@aquaq.co.uk";"test1@aquaq.co.uk")]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>emailreport</strong> - This accepts 3 parameters: temporary path, recipient
list, file name, file type and data. The data is written out as the file
type (e.g. csv, xml, txt, xls, json) with the given file name to the
temporary path. It is then emailed to the recipient list, and the
temporary file removed.</p>
<pre><code>emailreport["./tempdir/"; ("test@aquaq.co.uk";"test1@aquaq.co.uk"); "EndOfDayReport"; "csv"]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>publishresult</strong> - Accepts 1 parameter and that is the data. This is
discussed later in the subsection subresults.
Custom result handlers can be added to $KDBCODE/processes/reporter.q .
It is important to note that the result handler is referencing local
functions as it is executed in the reporter process and not the target
process. When the query has been successful the result handler will be
passed a dictionary with the following keys: queryid, time, name,
procname, proctype and result.</p>
<h3 id="report-process-tracking">Report Process Tracking</h3>
<p>Each step of the query is logged by the reporter process. Each query is
given a unique id and regular system messages are given the id 0. The
stage column specifies what stage the query is in and these are shown in
table [table:stagetable]. An appropriate log message is also shown so
any problems can easily be diagnosed. The in memory table is flushed
every interval depending on the value of the flushqueryloginterval
variable in the reporter.q file found in the $KDBCONFIG/settings
directory. </p>

<h3 id="subscribing-for-results">Subscribing for Results</h3>
<p>To publish the results of the report, the reporter process uses the pub
sub functionality of TorQ. This is done by using the using the inbuilt
result handler called publishresult. In order to subscribe to this feed,
connect to the reporter process and send the function shown below over
the handle. To subscribe to all reports use a backtick as the second
parameter and to subscribe to a specific reports results include the
reporter name as a symbol.</p>
<pre><code>/- define a upd function
upd:insert

/- handle to reporter process
h: hopen 20004

/- Subscribe to all results that use the publishresult handler
h(`.ps.subscribe;`reporterprocessresults;`)

/- Subscribe to a specific report called testreport
h(`.ps.subscribe;`reporterprocessresults;`testreport)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="example-reports">Example reports</h3>
<p>The following are examples of reports that could be used in the reporter
process. The rdbtablecount report will run hourly and return the count
of all the tables in a rdb process. The memoryusage report will run
every 10 minutes against the gateway for multiple processes and will
return the <code>.Q.w[]</code> information. Both of these reports run between
9:30am to 4:00pm during the weekdays. The report onetimequery is an
example of a query that is run one time, in order to run a query once,
the period must be the same as the difference between the start and end
time.</p>

<p><a name="monitor"></a></p>
<h2 id="monitor">Monitor</h2>
<p>The Monitor process is a simple process to monitor the health of the
other processes in the system. It connects to each process that it finds
(by default using the discovery service, though can use the static file
as well) and subscribes to both heartbeats and log messages. It
maintains a keyed table of heartbeats, and a table of all log messages
received.</p>
<p>Run it with:</p>
<pre><code>aquaq $ q torq.q -load code/processes/monitor.q -p 20001
</code></pre>
<p>It is probably advisable to run the monitor process with the -trap flag,
as there may be some start up errors if the processes it is connecting
to do not have the necessary heartbeating or publish/subscribe code
loaded.</p>
<pre><code>aquaq $ q torq.q -load code/processes/monitor.q -p 20001 -trap
</code></pre>
<p>The current heartbeat statuses are tracked in .hb.hb, and the log
messages in logmsg</p>
<pre><code>q)show .hb.hb

<h3 id="html5-front-end">HTML5 front end</h3>
<p>A HTML5 front end has been built to display important process
information that is sent from the monitor process. It uses HTML5,
WebSockets and JavaScript on the front end and interacts with the
monitor process in the kdb+ side. The features of the front end include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Heartbeat table with processes that have warnings highlighted in
    orange and errors in red</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log message table displaying the last 30 errors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log message error chart that is by default displayed in 5 minute
      bins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chart’s bin value can be changed on the fly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responsive design so works on all main devices i.e. phones, tablets
      and desktop</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is accessible by going to the url <code>http://HOST:PORT/.non?monitorui</code></p>
<p><a name="compress"></a></p>
<h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>
<p>The compression process is a thin wrapper around the compression utility
library. It allows periodic compression of whole or parts of databases
(e.g. data is written out uncompressed and then compressed after a
certain period of time). It uses four variables defined in
KDBCONFIG/settings/compression.q which specify</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the compression configuration file to use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the database directory to compress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the maximum age of data to attempt to compress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether the process should exit upon completion</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The process is run like other TorQ processes:</p>
<pre><code>q torq.q -load code/processes/compression.q -p 20005
</code></pre>
<p>Modify the settings file or override variables from the command line as
appropriate.</p>
<p><a name="kill"></a></p>
<h2 id="kill">Kill</h2>
<p>The kill process is used to connect to and terminate currently running
processes. It kills the process by sending the exit command therefore
the kill process must have appropriate permissions to send the command,
and it must be able to create a connection (i.e. it will not be able to
kill a blocked process in the same way that the unix command kill -9
would). By default, the kill process will connect to the discovery
service(s), and kill the processes of the specified types. The kill
process can be modified to not use the discovery service and instead use
the process.csv file via the configuration in the standard way.</p>
<p>If run without any command line parameters, kill.q will try to kill each
process it finds with type defined by its .servers.CONNECTIONS variable.</p>
<pre><code>q torq.q -load code/processes/kill.q -p 20000
</code></pre>
<p>.servers.CONNECTIONS can optionally be overridden from the command line
(as can any other process variable):</p>
<pre><code>q torq.q -load code/processes/kill.q -p 20000 -.servers.CONNECTIONS rdb tickerplant
</code></pre>
<p>The kill process can also be used to kill only specific named processes
within the process types:</p>
<pre><code>q torq.q -load code/processes/kill.q -p 20000 -killnames hdb1 hdb2
</code></pre>
<p><a name="chained"></a></p>
<h2 id="chained-tickerplant">Chained Tickerplant</h2>
<p>In tick+ architecture the main tickerplant is the most important
component, as it is relied upon by all the real time subscribers. When
the tickerplant goes down data will be lost, compare this to an rdb
which can be recovered after it fails. The chained tickerplant process
is an additional tickerplant that is a real time subscriber to the main
tickerplant but replicates its behaviour. It will have its own real time
subscribers and can be recovered when it fails. This is the recommended
approach when users want to perform their own custom real time analysis.</p>
<p>The chained tickerplant can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>subscribe to specific tables and syms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>batch publish at an interval or publish tick by tick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create a tickerplant log that its real time subscribers can replay</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>replay the source tickerplant log</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To launch the chained tickerplant</p>
<pre><code>q torq.q -load code/processes/chainedtp.q -p 12009
</code></pre>
<p>Chained tickerplant settings are found in <code>config/settings/chainedtp.q</code>
and are under the <code>.ctp</code> namespace.</p>
